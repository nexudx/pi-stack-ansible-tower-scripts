Role Name
=========

wifi-access: Allow the pi-stack to route over a wifi account into the internet.

Requirements
------------

Raspberry Pi 3 with wifi module.


Role Variables
--------------

A description of the settable variables for this role should go here, including any variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here as well.

Dependencies
------------

None.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: wifi-gateway
      roles:
         - { role: wifi-access }
